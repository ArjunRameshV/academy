# Anyscale Academy - Tutorials on Ray and Ray-based Libraries

Â© 2018-2020, Anyscale. All Rights Reserved

Welcome to the [Anyscale Academy](https://anyscale.com/academy) tutorials on [Ray](https://ray.io), the system for scaling your applications from a laptop to a cluster.

This README tells you how to set up the tutorials and it provides a quick overview of its contents.

> **Tips:**
>
> 1. This is an early release of these tutorials. Please report any issues:
>    * [GitHub issues](https://github.com/anyscale/academy/issues)
>    * The [#tutorial channel](https://ray-distributed.slack.com/archives/C011ML23W5B) on the [Ray Slack](https://ray-distributed.slack.com)
>    * [Email](mailto:academy@anyscale.com)
> 2. If you are attending a live tutorial event, please follow the setup instructions well in advance, as some of the downloads and installation processes can take a while.
> 3. There is a Troubleshooting section at the end of this README.

## Setup

The setup commands can take a while to finish.

Clone the [Academy GitHub repo](https://github.com/anyscale/academy) or [download the latest release](https://github.com/anyscale/academy/releases), which is best if you don't have `git` on your laptop.

#### Using Anaconda

We recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), especially if you do lots of Python development and you need to define different environments for different projects. However, Anaconda isn't required.

To install Anaconda, follow the instructions [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

Then run the following commands in the root directory of this project. First, we use `conda` to install the other dependencies, including Ray. Then we "activate" the newly-creatd environment, named `anyscale-academy`. Finally, uwe use the `jupyter` command to set up the graphing libraries in Jupyter Lab that we'll use.

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate anyscale-academy
jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager
jupyter labextension install @pyviz/jupyterlab_pyviz
jupyter labextension install @bokeh/jupyter_bokeh
```

This creates a Conda environment with the . Use the following command to activate it:

```
```

You are ready to go!

#### Using Pip

If you don't use Anaconda, you'll have to install prerequisites first:

* Python 3.6 to 3.8 (3.8 recommended)
    * The version of Python that comes with your operating system is probably too old. Try `python --version` to see what you have.
    * Installation instructions are at [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* Pip (a recent version)
	* Installation instructions are at [pip.pypa.io](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

Now you can run the following commands in the root directory of this project to complete the setup. First, you'll run a `pip` command to install the rest of the libraries required for these tutorials, including Ray. Then you'll run  `jupyter` commands to set up graphing libraries in Jupyter Lab. You will need an Internet connection and these commands will take a while to finish:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager
jupyter labextension install @pyviz/jupyterlab_pyviz
jupyter labextension install @bokeh/jupyter_bokeh
```

You are ready to go!

## Launching the Tutorials

The previous steps installed [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), the notebook-based environment we'll use for all the lessons. To start, make sure you are in the project root directory and run the following command:

```
jupyter lab
```

It should automatically open a browser window with the lab environment, but if not, the console output will show the URL you should use.

> **Tip:** If you accidentally close this browser window, just use the same URL to reopen it.

## Tutorial Modules

The rest of this information can also be found in the [Overview](./Overview.ipynb) notebook.

This directory contains files for setting up your environment (`README.md` - this file, `environment.yml`, and `requirements.txt`), which were discussed above, and the Apache license file (`LICENSE`).

The `util` directory contains library code used in the notebooks and the `images` directory contains images used in the notebooks.

Each tutorial _module_ is contained in a dedicated directory. Each  [Jupyter](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) notebook in a module is a _lesson_. The notebooks follow the naming convention `NN-name.ipynb`, where `NN` is a number that indicates the ordering of lessons.

> **Note:** If two or more notebooks have the same `NN` number, it indicates they can be studied an arbitrary order.

Let's discuss the modules. in this project, organized in subdirectories.

### Ray Core

Directory: `ray-core`

This is the place to start. This module introduces you to Ray, why it was created, what problems it solves, how to use it, and how it works behind the scenes.

Once you've completed the Ray core material, you can explore the rest of the modules in any order.

### Ray RLlib

Directory: `ray-rllib`

_Ray RLlib_ is Ray's system for _reinforcement learning_. This module begins with a "crash course" in RL concepts. It then explores several of the commonly-used algorithms and approaches for different applications.

This module will be released soon.

### Ray Tune and Ray SGD

Directory: `ray-tune`

_Ray Tune_ is Ray's system for _hyperparameter tuning_. This module starts with an explanation of what hyperparameter tuning is for and the performances challenges doing it for many applications. Then the module explores how to use _Tune_, how it integrates with several popular ML frameworks, and the algorithms supported in _Tune_. The new _Ray SGD_ module is also covered.

This module will be released soon.

### Ray Serve

Directory: `ray-serve`

_Ray Serve_ is Ray's system for scalable _model serving_, with capabilities that also make it suitable for other web server applications. This module starts with an explanation of what's required in model serving, followed by a tour of the API with examples.

This module will be released soon.

## Troubleshooting

When you first start Ray in the very first lesson (i.e., use `ray.init()`), you may run into a few issues:

1. If you get an error like `... INFO services.py:... -- Failed to connect to the redis server, retrying.`, it probably means you are running a VPN on your machine. [At this time](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/6573), you can't use `ray.init()` with a VPN running. You'll have to stop your VPN to run `ray.init()`, then once it finishes, you can restart your VPN.

2. If `ray.init()` worked (for example, you see a message like _View the Ray dashboard at localhost:8265_) and you're using a Mac, you may get several annoying dialogs asking you if you want to allow incoming connections for Python and/or Redis. Click "Accept" for each one and they shouldn't appear again during this tutorial. MacOS is trying to verify if these executables have been properly signed. Ray uses Redis. If you installed Python using Anaconda or other mechanism, then it probably isn't properly signed from the point of view of MacOS. To permanently fix this problem, [see this StackExchange post](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3271/how-to-get-rid-of-firewall-accept-incoming-connections-dialog).
