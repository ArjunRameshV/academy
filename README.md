## Videos of Previous Live Sessions

To see videos of live sessions covering most of this material, see the [Anyscale Academy](https://anyscale.com/academy/) page or visit the [Anyscale YouTube! channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7L1tZw52rtgmIB4fr_f40w/playlists).

## Tutorial Setup

Read the appropriate setup section that follows, then jump to [**Launching the Tutorials**](#user-content-launching-the-tutorials).

## Setup for Anyscale Academy Hosted Sessions

There is nothing you need to setup, as the hosted environment will provide everything.

However, consider cloning or downloading a release of the tutorial notebooks and supporting software from the [Academy repo](https://github.com/anyscale/academy), so you have a local copy of everything.

> **Tip:** If you modify any notebooks during the hosted session, make sure you download them to save those changes.

## Setup for a Local Machine

> **Note:** Ray support for Windows is new. See [these release notes](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/releases/tag/ray-0.8.7) for details.

Follow these instructions to use the tutorials. Note that some commands can take a while to finish.

Clone the [Academy GitHub repo](https://github.com/anyscale/academy) or [download the latest release](https://github.com/anyscale/academy/releases).

Now install the dependencies using either [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or `pip` in your Python environment. We recommend using Anaconda.

### Which Python Version?

Python 3.7 is recommended. While Ray supports Python 3.6, there are known problem using _locales_ in that version and these tutorials. Specifically, the following code throws an error:

```python
import locale
locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, locale.getlocale())
```

This tutorial doesn't manipulate _locales_ explicitly, but you may run into problems with your default locale.

While Ray supports Python 3.8, some dependencies used in `RLlib` (the Ray reinforcement library) are not yet supported for 3.8, at the time of this writing.

### Using Anaconda

If you need to install Anaconda, follow the instructions [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). If you already have Anaconda installed, consider running `conda upgrade --all`.

Run the following commands in the root directory of this project. First, use `conda` to install the other dependencies, including Ray. Then activate the newly-created environment, named `anyscale-academy`. Finally, run the provided `tools/fix-jupyter.sh` script to install a graphing library extension in Jupyter Lab and perform other tasks.

```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate anyscale-academy
tools/fix-jupyter.sh
```

If you are using Windows, see the [**Fixing Jupyter Lab on Windows**](#user-content-fixing-jupyter-lab-on-windows) below for an alternative to using `tools/fix-jupyter.sh`.

Note that Python 3.7 is used.

You can delete the environment later with the following command:

```
conda env remove --name anyscale-academy
```

### Using Pip

If you don't use Anaconda, you'll have to install these prerequisites first:

* Python 3.7:
	* See notes above about problems with 3.6 and 3.8. Don't use 3.8, but 3.6 may work for you.
    * The version of Python that comes with your operating system is probably too old. Try `python --version` to see what you have.
    * Installation instructions are at [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* Pip: A recent version - consider upgrading if it's not the latest version.
	* Installation instructions are at [pip.pypa.io](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).
* Node.js: Required for some of the Jupyter Lab graphics extensions we use.
	* Installation instructions are [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Next, run the following commands in the root directory of this project to complete the setup. First, run the `pip` command to install the rest of the libraries required for these tutorials, including Ray. Then, run the provided script to install a graphing library extension in Jupyter Lab and perform other tasks.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
tools/fix-jupyter.sh
```

If you are using Windows, see the [**Fixing Jupyter Lab on Windows**](#user-content-fixing-jupyter-lab-on-windows) below for an alternative to using `tools/fix-jupyter.sh`.

### Fixing Jupyter Lab on Windows

The `tools/fix-jupyter.sh` shell script runs the following commands. If you are using Windows, run them yourself as shown here.

First, see if the following `pyviz` extension is installed:

```
jupyter labextension check --installed "@pyviz/jupyterlab_pyviz"
```

If not, run this command:

```
jupyter labextension install "@pyviz/jupyterlab_pyviz"
```

Finally, run these commands:

```
jupyter labextension update --all
jupyter lab build
jupyter labextension list
```

### Final Installation Notes

If you use Jupyter a lot, consider installing [Kite](https://www.kite.com/) on your machine and the Jupter Lab plugin for Kite. Installation and usage instructions are [here](https://help.kite.com/category/138-jupyterlab-plugin).

When you have finished working through the tutorials, run the script `tools/cleanup.sh`, which prints temporary files, checkpoint directories, etc. that were created during the lessons. You might want to remove these as they can add up to 100s of MBs.

> **Note:** A Windows version of this script is TBD.

## Launching the Tutorials

The previous steps installed [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), the notebook-based environment we'll use for all the lessons. To start run the following command in the project root directory:

```shell
jupyter lab
```

It should automatically open a browser window with the lab environment, but if not, the console output will show the URL you should use.

> **Tip:** If you get an error that `jupyter` can't be found and you are using the Anaconda setup, make sure you activated the `anyscale-academy` environment, as shown above.

See the [Overview notebook](Overview.ipynb) for detailed, up-to-date descriptions for each tutorial and the lessons it contains.

## Troubleshooting and Further Information

See the [Troubleshooting, Tips, and Tricks](reference/Troubleshooting-Tips-Tricks.ipynb) notebook.

For details on the Ray API and the ML libraries, see the [Ray Docs](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/). For other information, see [ray.io](https://ray.io), including the [Ray blog](https://medium.com/distributed-computing-with-ray).

[Ray](https://ray.io) started at [U.C. Berkeley RISELab](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/). It is now developed in artisanal, small batches at [Anyscale](https://anyscale.com).

## Building Docker Images

Use the script `tools/make-docker-image.sh`. Look at the environment variables it uses and either edit or invoke accordingly. For example, to use a tagged GitHub release of the Academy code, `v1.2.3`, Docker image tag `1.2.3`, and a non-Anyscale organization:

```
$ tools/make-docker-image.sh GIT_TAG=v1.2.3 ORGANIZATION=myorg docker_make
```

Note that we didn't specify a Docker image tag; it defaults to `GIT_TAG` without the `v`.

Use `all` or no final argument instead of `docker_make` to build that target and `docker_upload` to your organization. (See the `Makefile`.)

So, this command does everything and also uses a custom Docker image tag:

```
$ tools/make-docker-image.sh GIT_TAG=v1.2.3 DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG=test1 ORGANIZATION=myorg
```
