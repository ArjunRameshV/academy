    "### ray.init() Fails\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get an error like `... INFO services.py:... -- Failed to connect to the redis server, retrying.`, it probably means you are running a VPN on your machine. [At this time](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/6573), you can't use `ray.init()` with a VPN running. You'll have to stop your VPN to run `ray.init()`, then once it finishes, you can restart your VPN.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Annoyances\n",
    "\n",
    "If `ray.init()` worked (for example, you see a message like _View the Ray dashboard at localhost:8265_) and you're using a Mac, you may get several annoying dialogs asking you if you want to allow incoming connections for `python` and/or `redis-server`. Click \"Accept\" for each one and they shouldn't appear again during this lesson. MacOS is trying to verify if these executables have been properly signed. Ray uses Redis. If you installed Python using Anaconda or other mechanism, then it probably isn't properly signed from the point of view of MacOS. To permanently fix this problem, [see this StackExchange post](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3271/how-to-get-rid-of-firewall-accept-incoming-connections-dialog)."

    "* Invocations return an `ObjectID` for a _future_. Use `ray.get(id)` to return the value.\n",
    "* However, `ray.get()` blocks, so consider using `ray.wait()` when waiting for a collection of futures, so as they become available, you can retrieve them with `ray.get()` (which won't block when we know the results are available), then process the results, all while waiting for the rest to finish.\n",
    "* Pick functions to parallelize that do enough work so that the Ray \"remoting\" overhead is not significant. Very short functions will actually yield lower performance if convert to tasks. \n",
    "* Similarly, avoid too many actors, as each one is pinned to memory until no longer needed."
