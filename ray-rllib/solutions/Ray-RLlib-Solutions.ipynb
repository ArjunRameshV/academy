    "Finish implementing the `rollout_policy` function below, which should take an environment *and* a policy. Recall that the *policy* is a function that takes in a *state* and returns an *action*. The main difference is that instead of choosing a **random action**, like we just did (with poor results), the action should be chosen **with the policy** (as a function of the state)."
