    "This part of the [RLlib tutorial](../00-Ray-RLlib-Overview.ipynb) tutorial introduces _multi-armed bandits_ a popular approach that is very similar to \"classic\" reinforcement learning (RL), but with some differences, which we'll cover in the [first lesson](01-Introduction-to-Multi-Armed-Bandits.ipynb). [RLlib](https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rllib.html) provides several bandit algorithms:\n",
