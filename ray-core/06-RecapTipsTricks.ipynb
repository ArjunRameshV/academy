    "## General Task and Actor Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "* To create a task from a function or an actor from a class, annotate it with `@ray.remote`.\n",
    "* Invoke tasks and actor methods (including the constructor) with `foo.remote(...)`.\n",
    "* Invocations return an `ObjectID` for a _future_. Use `ray.get(id)` to return the value.\n",
    "* However, `ray.get()` blocks, so consider using `ray.wait()` when waiting for a collection of futures, so as they become available, you can retrieve them with `ray.get()` (which won't block on available results), then process the results, all while waiting for the rest to finish.\n",
    "* Pick functions to parallelize that do enough work so that the Ray \"remoting\" overhead is not significant. Very short functions will actually yield lower performance if convert to tasks. \n",
    "* Similarly, avoid too many actors, as each one is pinned to memory until no longer needed."

    "### Using Existing Functions and Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "An existing function can be used as a task by defining a new task function that calls. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def work(args):\n",
    "    do_work(...)\n",
    "    \n",
    "@ray.remote\n",
    "def remote_work(args):\n",
    "    do_work(args)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to use both versions as appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, existing classes can be subclassed to create actors:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Counter():\n",
    "    def __init__(self, init_count):\n",
    "        self.count = init_count\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def increment():\n",
    "        self.count +=1\n",
    "        return self.count\n",
    "    \n",
    "@ray.remote\n",
    "class RemoteCounter(Counter):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, init_count):\n",
    "        super().__init__(init_count)\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def get_count():\n",
    "        return self.count\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we added a `get_count()` method, because member attributes can't be accessed directly, in contrast with normal classes.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

Unfortunately, you may be asked to enter the `sudo` password to use this feature, because of the way it instruments processes. Currently, the only way to get this to work with the Dashboard launched from notebooks is to use _passwordless sudo_. On MacOS and Linux systems, it should be sufficient to add a line like the following the `/etc/sudoers` (edited using `sudo visudo`!):\n",

When you click a link to profile code, as discussed next, you'll be prompted for your password in the terminal. (The prompt could get mixed with other output from the program.) Enter your password there and the profiling will continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using either approach, to profile with the Dashboard, click the _Logical View_ tab. It shows a list of actors that have been run or are running. Find the running actor that appears to be the one you want to profile. You'll see a line like this:\n",

    "> Actor <hex_number> (Profile for 10s 30s 60s) Kill Actor\n",
    "\n",
    "The _10s, 30s, 60s_ are links. Click the time you want (pick one that's shorter than the remaining execution time). \n",
    "\n",
    "When it finishes, click _Profile results_. A new tab opens with the _speedscope_ view of the data, which shows a flame graph. You can learn more about navigating and using this tool at the [speedscope GitHub site](https://github.com/jlfwong/speedscope)."

    "If you get an error like `... INFO services.py:... -- Failed to connect to the redis server, retrying.`, it probably means you are running a VPN on your machine. [At this time](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/6573), you can't use `ray.init()` with a VPN running. You'll have to stop your VPN to run `ray.init()`, then once it finishes, you can restart your VPN.\n",

    "### Annoyances\n",

    "If `ray.init()` worked (for example, you see a message like _View the Ray dashboard at localhost:8265_) and you're using a Mac, you may get several annoying dialogs asking you if you want to allow incoming connections for `python` and/or `redis-server`. Click \"Accept\" for each one and they shouldn't appear again during this lesson. MacOS is trying to verify if these executables have been properly signed. Ray uses Redis. If you installed Python using Anaconda or other mechanism, then it probably isn't properly signed from the point of view of MacOS.
