    "**Directory:** `ray-crash-course`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Audience:** You are a developer who wants a fast introduction to the core Ray API. The first two lessons cover the essential parts of the Ray API for _tasks_ and _actors_. The rest of the lessons explore the origin and goals for Ray, Ray replacement versions of several popular multiprocessing APIs, a Ray _parallel iterator_ API, and working with Ray clusters using the `ray` command-line interface (CLI).\n",
    "\n",
    "Experienced developers should go to [_Advanced Ray_](#user-content-advanced-ray). Data scientists may wish to skip to [_Ray RLlib_](#user-content-ray-rllib), [_Ray Tune_](#user-content-ray-tune), [_Ray SGD_](#user-content-ray-sgd), or [_Ray Serve_](#user-content-ray-serve).\n",

    "\n",
    "The _crash course_ is intended to focus on learning the core API as quickly as possible, but using nontrivial examples. In contrast, the [_Advanced Ray_](#user-content-advanced-ray) tutorial begins with an explanation of why Ray was created, what problems it solves, and then dives into more advanced API usage, profiling and debugging applications, and how Ray works behind the scenes.\n",
