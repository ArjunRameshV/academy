    "## Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "When you first start Ray in the very first lesson (i.e., use `ray.init()`), you may run into a few issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you get an error like `... INFO services.py:... -- Failed to connect to the redis server, retrying.`, it probably means you are running a VPN on your machine. [At this time](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/6573), you can't use `ray.init()` with a VPN running. You'll have to stop your VPN for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If `ray.init()` worked (for example, you see a message like _View the Ray dashboard at localhost:8265_) and you're using a Mac, you may get several annoying dialogs asking you if you want to allow incoming connections for Python and/or Redis. Click \"Accept\" for each one and they shouldn't appear again during this tutorial. MacOS is trying to verify if these executables have been properly signed. Ray uses Redis. If you installed Python using Anaconda or other mechanism, then it probably isn't properly signed from the point of view of MacOS. To permanently fix this problem, [see this StackExchange post](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3271/how-to-get-rid-of-firewall-accept-incoming-connections-dialog). "
