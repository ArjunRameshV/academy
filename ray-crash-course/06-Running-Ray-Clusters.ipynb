    "# Ray Crash Course - Ray Clusters and the Ray CLI\n",
    "\n",
    "We used the `../tools/start-ray.sh` script to run a Ray \"cluster\" on our local machines or to detect that one is running already, such as when you go through these lessons using the Anyscale hosted platform. This script uses the Ray CLI command `ray` to perform these tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's briefly explore a few of the Ray CLI subcommands. For the full documentation, see the ray documentation for the [Ray CLI](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/package-ref.html#the-ray-command-line-api). See also the [Cluster Setup](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster-index.html) section.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip:** If any of the CLI commands used here print a lot of output, right click on the output and select _Enable Scrolling for Outputs_.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** The Anyscale hosted platform has its own CLI command, `anyscale`, which integrates the `ray` CLI and provides other capabilities for managing and running Ray projects and sessions, including automated cluster integration, synchronization of code to your local development environment, etc. Further information on this service will be available soon. [Contact us](mailto:academy@anyscale.com) for details."
