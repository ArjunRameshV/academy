    "This tutorial, part of [Anyscale Academy](https://anyscale.com/academy), provides a \"just the facts\" introduction to [Ray](https://ray.io), the system for scaling your applications from a laptop to a cluster. Here, we start with a hands on exploration of the core Ray API for distributed work loads:\n",

    "* Ray _tasks_: Distributed execution of _stateless_ Python functions.\n",
    "* Ray _actors_: Distributed execution of _stateful_ Python classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequent lessons explore the origin and goals for Ray, Ray replacement versions of several popular multiprocessing APIs, a Ray _parallel iterator_ API, and working with Ray clusters using the `ray` command-line interface (CLI).\n",
